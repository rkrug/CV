  abstract = {Ecological and evolutionary research increasingly uses quantitative synthesis of primary research studies (meta-analysis) for answering fundamental questions, informing environmental policy and summarizing results for decision makers. Knowing how meta-analysis works is important for researchers so that their research can have broader impact. Meta-analytic thinking encourages scientists to see single primary research studies as substantial contributions to a larger picture. To facilitate inclusion in a meta-analysis, relevant primary research studies must be found and basic information about the methods and results must be thoroughly, clearly and transparently reported. While many published papers provide this information, it is common for essential data to be omitted, leading to study exclusion from meta-analyses. We provide guidelines for correctly reporting basic data needed from primary studies in ecology and evolutionary biology so that they can be included in meta-analyses, together with examples that show how data should be reported to enable calculation and analysis of effect sizes, and how data should be made accessible. These guidelines are important for reporting research results in general, whether or not results are included in subsequent meta-analyses, because they are necessary for the interpretation and assessment of study outcomes. Increased implementation of these guidelines by authors, editors and publishers, and reinforcement by funders, will foster higher quality and more inclusive syntheses, further the goals of transparency and reproducibility in science, and improve the quality and value of primary research studies.},

  title = {Modelling Seed Dispersal in Restoration and Invasions.},
  copyright = {All rights reserved},
  abstract = {Dispersal plays an essential role in determining the distribution of populations of species,
 especially species expanding their ranges. Two disciplines are concerned with gaining
 understanding of spread of species, namely restoration ecology and invasion biology. Con-
 ceptual understanding of dispersal, its mechanisms and its management is essential to both
 disciplines. Nevertheless, the disciplines have quite opposite objectives: in restoration ecol-
 ogy, spread of indigenous species into transformed landscapes is promoted, while invasion
 biology aims to prevent the (further) spread of alien species into pristine or restored habi-
 tats. Despite these two opposite objectives of facilitating spread and preventing spread of
 their respective target species, these disciplines have essentially the same requirements in
 terms of information needed for restoration. In this thesis, I will present two modelling
 studies\textemdash{}one looking at the impact of two different seed-feeding alien control agents on
 the spread of Hakea sericea, the other investigating the recolonisation by Dicerothamnus
 rhinocerotis of an old field dominated by Cynodon dactylon. Based on these studies, I
 will draw conclusions for the management in each case. In a second step, I will compare
 these two seemingly-different studies and draw conclusions on how these two disciplines
 can learn from each other, and how conclusions drawn and management recommendations
 developed for the one discipline can be translated for the other. The invasion biology
 study concluded that seed-feeding biocontrol agents do have a considerable impact on the
 velocity of the spread of the target species. In addition, management recommendations
 included the possibility of substituting seed-feeding biocontrol agents with an increased
 fire frequency where the negative impact on natural vegetation, on the site invaded by the
 target species, is acceptable. The restoration study concluded that the main impact on the
 velocity of spread, and the speed of the return of the shrub species onto the old fields, is
 the availability of micro-sites. A sensitivity analysis showed the even a slight change from
 1\% to 2\% increases the velocity and pattern of spread dramatically. The other parameters
 playing an important role are the mean rate of establishment and the time span between},

Multiple factors that drive invasion and which interact in complex ways demand innovative management approaches. We show the utility of scenario planning in considering options for management in a region with substantial problems with invasive alien plants: South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. The approach allows us to identify the driving forces that shape the status and trajectories of major woody invasive plants and to identify sensible strategies by considering a set of scenarios based on the main uncertainties that encapsulate the linkages between the various components of the management of biological invasions. Attitudes of landowners and management capacity are shown to be the crucial uncertainties influencing the spread of major invasive species; axes based on these factors define our scenarios. Mapping current management projects onto scenario axes highlighted key differences among areas. These insights can assist in directing particular management units toward more desirable futures. Our study highlights the need to link social, political and legal constraints with ecological processes to assure the effectiveness of management operations in controlling biological invasions.},

  abstract = {This paper reports on the development and testing of a simulation model to assess the impacts of two seed-feeding biological control agents on the dispersal of an invasive perennial tree, Hakea sericea (Proteaceae), which was introduced into South Africa from Australia during the 1850s. The agents are known to reduce seed banks at the individual plant level but the population-level effects are not well understood. The aim of the study was to estimate the extent to which the biological control has reduced the population growth and rate of spread of this species. H. sericea is a serotinous species which releases its wind-dispersed seeds en masse when the parent plants are killed, usually by fire. Field data were used to develop functions describing the fecundity of the plants and the impacts of the biological control agents as well as seedling recruitment rates and density dependent mortality. A group of `experts' provided estimates of the cumulative proportion of seeds that would disperse over distances from 50 to 1000m following a fire. The estimates were used to fit various long-range dispersal functions. The Weibull distribution gave the overall best fit and was used to generate parameter sets from each expert's estimates of dispersal. Simulations were then run using a reasonable range of fire intervals and dispersal parameters for the two experts whose estimates represented the minimum and maximum dispersal distances. Biological control agents have reduced the seed loads on H. sericea plants by more than 95\%. This, in turn, reduced population growth rates, maximum seed dispersal distances and the formation of new invasion foci. Population growth rates and spread rates were positively correlated because greater dispersal distances resulted in lower densities and, thus, lower levels of density dependent mortality. Numerous previous studies have found that biological control can limit population growth rates of invasive plants, but this is one of the few to have estimated the impacts on the invasion rates and to use an individual-based modelling approach to estimate population-level effects.},

  abstract = {Determining the geographical range of invasive species is an important component of formulating effective management strategies. In the absence of detailed distributional data, species distribution models can provide estimates of an invasion range and increase our understanding of the ecological processes acting at various spatial scales. We used two complementary approaches to evaluate the influence of historical and environmental factors in shaping the distribution of the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), a widespread, highly invasive species native to South America. Occurrence data were combined with environmental data at incremental spatial scales (extent and resolution) to predict the suitable range of the ant invasion using ecological niche models. In addition, we also used a spread model that simulated the jump dispersal of the species to identify the most plausible scenarios of arrival of L. humile in the NE Iberian Peninsula at local scales. Based on the results of both modelling practices, we suggest that L. humile might have reached its maximum geographic range at regional scales in the NE Iberian Peninsula. However, the species does not appear in equilibrium with the environment at small spatial scales, and further expansions are expected along coastal and inland localities of the Costa Brava. Long-distance jumps are ultimately responsible for the spread of the Argentine ant in the area. Overall, our study shows the utility of combining niche based models with spread models to understand the dynamics of species' invasions.},

  abstract = {Invasive alien trees and shrubs pose significant threats to biodiversity and ecosystem services in South African fynbos ecosystems. An ambitious initiative, the Working for Water program, commenced in 1995 to reduce the extent and impact of plant invasions. Despite substantial progress, the problem remains immense, and innovative ways of improving the efficiency of control operations are urgently needed. This study sought to develop a robust conceptual framework for effective management of the most important invasive alien plant (IAP) species. Two methods were applied in exploring the complexity of problems, thereby identifying appropriate response strategies. The DPSIR (Driving forces-Pressure-State-Impacts-Responses) framework and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) tool were used to design a strategy for prioritizing management actions. This strategy considers explicitly the most influential factors that determine the distribution, abundance, spread and impacts of IAPs. Efficient management of IAPs is constrained by multiple interacting environmental and socio-economic factors. Factors related to the fire-prone nature of the ecosystem and the characteristics of the invasive stands emerged as pivotal features for setting spatially-explicit priorities for management. Results of the analyses provide an objective and quantifiable perspective for improving the management efficiency. We conclude that considerable progress in controlling the spread of IAPs in fynbos ecosystems could be achieved by better coordination of management practices and by improving the quality of species distribution data.},

  shorttitle = {Clearing of Invasive Alien Plants under Different Budget Scenarios},
  abstract = {Clearing of invasive alien plants (IAPs) is a necessary but expensive exercise. Typically, insufficient resources are available to clear all areas simultaneously. Consequently areas need to be prioritized for clearing. The financial resources available determine the extent of the area which can be cleared, while the prioritization identifies the location of the areas to be cleared. We investigate the following questions: (1) How does a change in the budget impact on the efficiency of the clearing operations over time? (2) How does this differ for different sites? (3) Can we identify pattern which make it possible for managers to determine if their budget is sufficient to achieve a management goal (e.g. clearing 95\% of the area of IAPs) in a given time? (4) Can we draw general rules about how the time needed of achieving a management goal is changing when increasing the budget? We use a spatio-temporal explicit simulation model (SpreadSim) to simulate the spread of major woody IAPs over time, using a random prioritization strategy as a null model. This strategy requires no understanding or assumptions about the factors influencing spread; it is thus a reasonable baseline prioritization strategy. Our results confirm that a reduction of the budget increases the time needed to reach a management goal of 95\% non-invaded areas and simultaneously increases the overall budget needed to achieve this goal. In addition, for each site, we can identify three values. Firstly, a ``lower critical limit'' of the budget, below which the IAP spread is only slowed down and management does not result in a reduction of the area invaded by IAPs, which is independent of the management goal. Secondly, the ``critical budget'', at which we have a chance of more than 50\% of achieving our management goal in a given time. Thirdly, an ``upper critical limit'' for the budget, above which no substantial change in the time needed to reach the management goal can be observed. For all our three sites, the ``upper critical limit'' is located at approximately 1.7 times the ``critical budget''. The variability of the temporal trajectories of the area covered by IAPs for different simulations for the same input parameter and highly non-linear change in IAP cover over time indicate that an identification of the ``critical budget'' based on few years of IAP management is nearly impossible and that the use of simulation models is imperative. Nevertheless, the general pattern observed can be generalized to other prioritization strategies and provide important guidance for budget allocations.},

  abstract = {Determining the potential range of invasive alien species under current conditions is important. However, we also need to consider future distributions under scenarios of climate change and different management interventions when formulating effective long-term intervention strategies. This paper combines niche modelling and fine-scale process-based modelling to define regions at high risk of invasion and simulate likely dynamics at the landscape scale. Our study species is Schinus molle (Peruvian pepper tree; Anacardiaceae), a native of central South America, introduced to South Africa in about 1850 where it was widely planted along roads. Localities of planted and naturalized trees were mapped along 5380 km of roads \textendash{} a transect that effectively samples a large part of western South Africa. Correlative modelling was used to produce profiles of present and future environmental conditions characterizing its planted and naturalized ranges. A cellular-automata simulation model was used to estimate the dynamics of S. molle under future climates and different management scenarios. The overall potential range of S. molle in the region is predicted to shrink progressively with predicted climate change. Some of the potential range of S. molle defined based on current conditions (including areas where it is currently highly invasive) is likely to become less favourable. The species could persist where it is well established long after conditions for recruitment have deteriorated. Some areas where the species is not widely naturalized now (notably the fynbos biome) are likely to become more favourable. Our modelling approach allows for the delineation of areas likely to be invaded in future by considering a range of factors at different scales that mediate the interplay of climatic variables and other drivers that define the dimensions of human intervention such as distance from planted trees and the density of planted plants, both of which affect propagule pressure.},

Most management guidelines, therefore, tend to be extremely general and based on biogeography rather than population dynamics. Reviews on the current state of the art in connection with fragmentation research (population biology and genetics) are presented. The focus is put on the most important results of a large German project, which emphasises the application of metapopulation and minimum viable population theory in Central European cultural landscapes. This is supplemented by case studies from Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. The book is aimed at scientists in ecology and nature conservation as well as graduate students and people working in conservation practice.},

  abstract = {Intraspecific trait change, including altered behaviour or morphology, can drive temporal variation in interspecific interactions and population dynamics. In turn, variation in species' interactions and densities can alter the strength and direction of trait change. The resulting feedback between species' traits and abundance permits a wide range of community dynamics that would not be expected from ecological theories purely based on species abundances. Despite the theoretical importance of these interrelated processes, unambiguous experimental evidence of how intraspecific trait variation modifies species interactions and population dynamics and how this feeds back to influence trait variation is currently required. We investigate the role of trait-mediated demography in determining community dynamics and examine how ecological interactions influence trait change. We concurrently monitored the dynamics of community abundances and individual traits in an experimental microbial predator\textendash{}prey\textendash{}resource system. Using this data, we parameterised a trait-dependent community model to identify key ecologically relevant traits and to link trait dynamics with those of species abundances. Our results provide clear evidence of a feedback between trait change, demographic rates and species dynamics. The inclusion of trait\textendash{}abundance feedbacks into our population model improved the predictability of ecological dynamics from r2 of 34\% to 57\% and confirmed theoretical expectations of density-dependent population growth and species interactions in the system. Additionally, our model revealed that the feedbacks were underpinned by a trade-off between population growth and anti-predatory defence. High predator abundance was linked to a reduction in prey body size. This prey size decrease was associated with a reduction in its rate of consumption by predators and a decrease in its resource consumption. Modelling trait\textendash{}abundance feedbacks allowed us to pinpoint the underlying life history trade-off which links trait and abundance dynamics. These results show that accounting for trait\textendash{}abundance feedbacks has the potential to improve understanding and predictability of ecological dynamics.

  abstract = {Competition for limiting resources long has been considered an important factor generating community structure. A minimal model of resource competition predicts that the species that reduces the limiting resource R to the lowest level (R{${_\ast}$}R\^\{*\}) will exclude its competitors. Whether this ``R{${_\ast}$}R\^\{*\} rule'' is robust to violations of model assumptions remains largely unknown. I conducted a competition experiment with four species of bacterivorous protists in laboratory microcosms and predicted the outcome from each species' R{${_\ast}$}R\^\{*\} value. I also examined how the outcome of competition, species abundances, and the effect of protists on bacterial density varied with productivity. Microcosms were unstirred batch cultures containing a variety of bacteria, challenging the robustness of the simplest competition models. Protists with low R{${_\ast}$}R\^\{*\} values were less affected by competition, although competing protists often coexisted. The values of R{${_\ast}$}R\^\{*\} can predict competitive dominance, even in the absence of competitive exclusion. Other model predictions were less robust. Contrary to expectation, densities of grazed bacteria increased with productivity, and the effect of some protists on bacterial density did not vary with productivity. Bacterial heterogeneity may account for deviations from model predictions. Further experiments should examine the conditions under which simple rules can be expected to identify dominant species.},

  volume = {460},

  abstract = {Spatially synchronized fluctuations in system state are common in physical and biological systems ranging from individual atoms1 to species as diverse as viruses, insects and mammals2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Although the causal factors are well known for many synchronized phenomena, several processes concurrently have an impact on spatial synchrony of species, making their separate effects and interactions difficult to quantify. Here we develop a general stochastic model of predator\textendash{}prey spatial dynamics to predict the outcome of a laboratory microcosm experiment testing for interactions among all known synchronizing factors: (1) dispersal of individuals between populations; (2) spatially synchronous fluctuations in exogenous environmental factors (the Moran effect); and (3) interactions with other species (for example, predators) that are themselves spatially synchronized. The Moran effect synchronized populations of the ciliate protist Tetrahymena pyriformis; however, dispersal only synchronized prey populations in the presence of the predator Euplotes patella. Both model and data indicate that synchrony depends on cyclic dynamics generated by the predator. Dispersal, but not the Moran effect, `phase-locks' cycles, which otherwise become `decoherent' and drift out of phase. In the absence of cycles, phase-locking is not possible and the synchronizing effect of dispersal is negligible. Interspecific interactions determine population synchrony, not by providing an additional source of synchronized fluctuations, but by altering population dynamics and thereby enhancing the action of dispersal. Our results are robust to wide variation in model parameters representative of many natural predator\textendash{}prey or host\textendash{}pathogen systems. This explains why cyclic systems provide many of the most dramatic examples of spatial synchrony in nature.},

  abstract = {Ecologists know relatively little about the manner in which disturbance affects the likelihood of alternative community stable states and how the history of community assembly affects the relationship between disturbance and species diversity. Using microbial communities comprising bacterivorous ciliated protists assembled in laboratory microcosms, we experimentally investigated these questions by independently manipulating the intensity of disturbance (in the form of density-independent mortality) and community assembly history (including a control treatment with simultaneous species introduction and five sequential assembly treatments). Species diversity patterns consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis emerged in the controls, as several species showed responses indicative of a trade-off between competitive ability and ability to recover from disturbance. Species diversity in communities with sequential assembly, however, generally declined with disturbance, owing to the increased extinction risk of later colonizers at the intermediate level of disturbance. Similarities among communities subjected to different assembly histories increased with disturbance, a result due possibly to increasing disturbance reducing the importance of competition and hence priority effects. This finding is most consistent with the idea that increasing disturbance tends to reduce the likelihood of alternative stable states. Collectively, these results indicate the strong interactive effects of disturbance and assembly history on the structure of ecological communities.},

  shorttitle = {The {{Bari Manifesto}}},
  abstract = {Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) are fundamental variables that can be used for assessing biodiversity change over time, for determining adherence to biodiversity policy, for monitoring progress towards sustainable development goals, and for tracking biodiversity responses to disturbances and management interventions. Data from observations or models that provide measured or estimated EBV values, which we refer to as EBV data products, can help to capture the above processes and trends and can serve as a coherent framework for documenting trends in biodiversity. Using primary biodiversity records and other raw data as sources to produce EBV data products depends on cooperation and interoperability among multiple stakeholders, including those collecting and mobilising data for EBVs and those producing, publishing and preserving EBV data products. Here, we encapsulate ten principles for the current best practice in EBV-focused biodiversity informatics as `The Bari Manifesto', serving as implementation guidelines for data and research infrastructure providers to support the emerging EBV operational framework based on trans-national and cross-infrastructure scientific workflows. The principles provide guidance on how to contribute towards the production of EBV data products that are globally oriented, while remaining appropriate to the producer's own mission, vision and goals. These ten principles cover: data management planning; data structure; metadata; services; data quality; workflows; provenance; ontologies/vocabularies; data preservation; and accessibility. For each principle, desired outcomes and goals have been formulated. Some specific actions related to fulfilling the Bari Manifesto principles are highlighted in the context of each of four groups of organizations contributing to enabling data interoperability - data standards bodies, research data infrastructures, the pertinent research communities, and funders. The Bari Manifesto provides a roadmap enabling support for routine generation of EBV data products, and increases the likelihood of success for a global EBV framework.},

It is distinct from uncertainty analysis, which addresses the question `How uncertain is the prediction?' Uncertainty analysis needs to map what a model does when selected input assumptions and parameters are left free to vary over their range of existence, and this is equally true of a sensitivity analysis. Despite this, many uncertainty and sensitivity analyses still explore the input space moving along one-dimensional corridors leaving space of the input factors mostly unexplored. Our extensive systematic literature review shows that many highly cited papers (42\% in the present analysis) fail the elementary requirement to properly explore the space of the input factors. The results, while discipline-dependent, point to a worrying lack of standards and recognized good practices. We end by exploring possible reasons for this problem, and suggest some guidelines for proper use of the methods.},

  abstract = {Systematic reviews are difficult to keep up to date, but failure to do so leads to a decay in review currency, accuracy, and utility. We are developing a novel approach to systematic review updating termed ``Living systematic review'' (LSR): systematic reviews that are continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available. LSRs may be particularly important in fields where research evidence is emerging rapidly, current evidence is uncertain, and new research may change policy or practice decisions. We hypothesize that a continual approach to updating will achieve greater currency and validity, and increase the benefits to end users, with feasible resource requirements over time.},

  shorttitle = {Living Systematic Reviews},
  abstract = {New approaches to evidence synthesis, which use human effort and machine automation in mutually reinforcing ways, can enhance the feasibility and sustainability of living systematic reviews. Human effort is a scarce and valuable resource, required when automation is impossible or undesirable, and includes contributions from online communities (``crowds'') as well as more conventional contributions from review authors and information specialists. Automation can assist with some systematic review tasks, including searching, eligibility assessment, identification and retrieval of full-text reports, extraction of data, and risk of bias assessment. Workflows can be developed in which human effort and machine automation can each enable the other to operate in more effective and efficient ways, offering substantial enhancement to the productivity of systematic reviews. This paper describes and discusses the potential\textemdash{}and limitations\textemdash{}of new ways of undertaking specific tasks in living systematic reviews, identifying areas where these human/machine ``technologies'' are already in use, and where further research and development is needed. While the context is living systematic reviews, many of these enabling technologies apply equally to standard approaches to systematic reviewing.},

  volume = {91},
  issn = {0895-4356},
  shorttitle = {Living Systematic Reviews},
  abstract = {A living systematic review (LSR) should keep the review current as new research evidence emerges. Any meta-analyses included in the review will also need updating as new material is identified. If the aim of the review is solely to present the best current evidence standard meta-analysis may be sufficient, provided reviewers are aware that results may change at later updates. If the review is used in a decision-making context, more caution may be needed. When using standard meta-analysis methods, the chance of incorrectly concluding that any updated meta-analysis is statistically significant when there is no effect (the type I error) increases rapidly as more updates are performed. Inaccurate estimation of any heterogeneity across studies may also lead to inappropriate conclusions. This paper considers four methods to avoid some of these statistical problems when updating meta-analyses: two methods, that is, law of the iterated logarithm and the Shuster method control primarily for inflation of type I error and two other methods, that is, trial sequential analysis and sequential meta-analysis control for type I and II errors (failing to detect a genuine effect) and take account of heterogeneity. This paper compares the methods and considers how they could be applied to LSRs.},

  abstract = {While it is important for the evidence supporting practice guidelines to be current, that is often not the case. The advent of living systematic reviews has made the concept of ``living guidelines'' realistic, with the promise to provide timely, up-to-date and high-quality guidance to target users. We define living guidelines as an optimization of the guideline development process to allow updating individual recommendations as soon as new relevant evidence becomes available. A major implication of that definition is that the unit of update is the individual recommendation and not the whole guideline. We then discuss when living guidelines are appropriate, the workflows required to support them, the collaboration between living systematic reviews and living guideline teams, the thresholds for changing recommendations, and potential approaches to publication and dissemination. The success and sustainability of the concept of living guideline will depend on those of its major pillar, the living systematic review. We conclude that guideline developers should both experiment with and research the process of living guidelines.},

Even though they are seen as the ``gold standard'' when synthesising primary research, systematic reviews and maps are typically resource-intensive and complex activities. Thus, managing the conduct and reporting of such reviews can become a time consuming and challenging task. This paper introduces the open access online tool CADIMA, which was developed through a collaboration between the Julius K{\"u}hn-Institut and the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence, in order to increase the efficiency of the evidence synthesis process and facilitate reporting of all activities to maximise methodological rigour. Furthermore, we analyse how CADIMA compares with other available tools by providing a comprehensive summary of existing software designed for the purposes of systematic review management. We show that CADIMA is the only available open access tool that is designed to: (1) assist throughout the systematic review/map process; (2) be suited to reviews broader than medical sciences; (3) allow for offline data extraction; and, (4) support working as a review team.},

Current functionalities of metagear include the following: an abstract screener GUI to efficiently sieve bibliographic information from large numbers of candidate studies; tools to assign screening effort across multiple collaborators/reviewers and to assess inter-reviewer reliability using kappa statistics; PDF downloader to automate the retrieval of journal articles from online data bases; automated data extractions from scatter-plots, box-plots and bar-plots; PRISMA flow diagrams; simple imputation tools to fill gaps in incomplete or missing study parameters; generation of random-effects sizes for Hedges' d, log response ratio, odds ratio and correlation coefficients for Monte Carlo experiments; covariance equations for modelling dependencies among multiple effect sizes (e.g. with a common control, phylogenetic correlations); and finally, summaries that replicate analyses and outputs from widely used but no longer updated meta-analysis software. Research synthesis practices are vital to many disciplines in the sciences, including ecology and evolutionary biology, and metagear aims to enrich the scope, quality and reproducibility of what can be achieved with the systematic review and meta-analysis of research outcomes.},

It is particularly suitable for science mapping at a time when the emphasis on empirical contributions is producing voluminous, fragmented, and controversial research streams. Science mapping is complex and unwieldly because it is multi-step and frequently requires numerous and diverse software tools, which are not all necessarily freeware. Although automated workflows that integrate these software tools into an organized data flow are emerging, in this paper we propose a unique open-source tool, designed by the authors, called bibliometrix, for performing comprehensive science mapping analysis. bibliometrix supports a recommended workflow to perform bibliometric analyses. As it is programmed in R, the proposed tool is flexible and can be rapidly upgraded and integrated with other statistical R-packages. It is therefore useful in a constantly changing science such as bibliometrics.},

Despite the tight historical links between science and philosophy, present-day scientists often perceive philosophy as completely different from, and even antagonistic to, science. We argue here that, to the contrary, philosophy can have an important and productive impact on science.

Despite the tight historical links between science and philosophy, hearkening back to Plato, Aristotle, and others (here evoked with Raphael's famous School of Athens), present-day scientists often perceive philosophy as completely different from, and even antagonistic to, science. To the contrary, we believe philosophy can have an important and productive impact on science. Image credit: Shutterstock.com/Isogood\_patrick.

We illustrate our point with three examples taken from various fields of the contemporary life sciences. Each bears on cutting-edge scientific research, and each has been explicitly acknowledged by practicing researchers as a useful contribution to science. These and other examples show that philosophy's contribution can take at least four forms: the clarification of scientific concepts, the critical assessment of scientific assumptions or methods, the formulation of new concepts and theories, and the fostering of dialogue between different sciences, as well as between science and society.

First, philosophy offers conceptual clarification. Conceptual clarifications not only improve the precision and utility of scientific terms but also lead to novel experimental investigations because the choice of a given conceptual framework strongly constrains how experiments are conceived.

The definition of stem cells is a prime example. Philosophy has a long tradition of investigating properties, and the tools in use in this tradition \ldots{}

  abstract = {Starting with the Berlin declaration in 2003, Open Access (OA) publishing has established a new era of scholarly communication due to the unrestricted electronic access to peer reviewed publications. OA offers a number of benefits like e.g. increased citation counts (Gargouri et al., 2010) and enhanced visibility and accessibility of research output (Tennant et al., 2016). The OA movement with its powerful mandating and policymaking has been very successful in recent years. Relatively little is known about the real effects of these activities in terms of OA publication output of institutions on a larger scale (Piwowar et al., 2018). The aim of this article is to investigate to what extent the OA fraction of the publication output of German universities has increased in the last years. To answer this question, we analysed and compared total number of publications which have been published by researchers of the largest German universities. We compared the numbers of OA versus closed publications for 66 large German universities in the time span of 2000-2017.},

  abstract = {The study of biodiversity has grown exponentially in the last thirty years in response to demands for greater understanding of the function and importance of Earth's biodiversity and finding solutions to conserve it. Here, we test the hypothesis that biodiversity science has become more interdisciplinary over time. To do so, we analyze 97,945 peer-reviewed articles over a twenty-two-year time period (1990\textendash{}2012) with a continuous time dynamic model, which classifies articles into concepts (i.e., topics and ideas) based on word co-occurrences. Using the model output, we then quantify different aspects of interdisciplinarity: concept diversity, that is, the diversity of topics and ideas across subdisciplines in biodiversity science, subdiscipline diversity, that is, the diversity of subdisciplines across concepts, and network structure, which captures interactions between concepts and subdisciplines. We found that, on average, concept and subdiscipline diversity in biodiversity science were either stable or declining, patterns which were driven by the persistence of rare concepts and subdisciplines and a decline in the diversity of common concepts and subdisciplines, respectively. Moreover, our results provide evidence that conceptual homogenization, that is, decreases in temporal {$\beta$} concept diversity, underlies the observed trends in interdisciplinarity. Together, our results reveal that biodiversity science is undergoing a dynamic phase as a scientific discipline that is consolidating around a core set of concepts. Our results suggest that progress toward addressing the biodiversity crisis via greater interdisciplinarity during the study period may have been slowed by extrinsic factors, such as the failure to invest in research spanning across concepts and disciplines. However, recent initiatives such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) may attract broader support for biodiversity-related issues and hence interdisciplinary approaches to address scientific, political, and societal challenges in the coming years.},

  abstract = {Human activities are causing major changes in biological communities worldwide. Due to concern about the consequences of these changes, an academic conversation about biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) has emerged over the last few decades. Here we use a keyword co-occurrence analysis to characterize and review 28 years of research focused on these terms. We find that the rapidly growing literature has developed in four research domains. The first two domains ``BEF Experiments'' and ``Science Policy'' emerge early, and persist through time, as core research areas with emphases on experiments and management, respectively. The second two domains, ``Agricultural Landscapes'' and ``Aquatic Food Webs'', arise as integrative domains that connect divisions in scientific discussion surrounding BEF Experiments and Science Policy. Terms related to species interactions (i.e. pollinator, predator, food web) appear more commonly in the two integrative domains reflecting shared interests of many scientists focusing on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Despite shared interests in food webs, research in the four domains differ with respect to their spatial scale, baseline comparisons, and currency of measurements. Food-web research that bridges these divides should be pushed to the forefront of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning research priorities.},

  abstract = {1.Toytree is a lightweight Python library for programmatically visualizing and manipulating tree-based data structures. It implements a minimalist design aesthetic and modern plotting architecture suited for interactive coding in IPython/Jupyter. 2. Tree drawings are generated in HTML using the Toyplot library backend, and display natively in Jupyter notebooks with interactivity features. Tree drawings can be combined with other plotting functions from the Toyplot library (e.g., scatterplots, histograms) to create composite figures on a shared coordinate grid, and can be exported to additional formats including PNG, PDF and SVG. 3. To parse and store tree data Toytree uses a modified fork of the ete3 TreeNode object, which includes functions for manipulating, annotating, and comparing trees. Toytree integrates these functions with a plotting layout to allow node values to be extracted from trees in the correct order to style nodes for plotting. In addition, Toytree provides functions for parsing additional tree formats, generating random trees, inferring consensus trees, and drawing grids or clouds from multiple trees to visualize discordance. 4. The goal of toytree is to provide a simple Python equivalent to commonly used tree manipulation and plotting libraries in R, and in doing so, to promote further development of phylogenetic and other tree-based methods in Python. Toytree is released under the GPLv3 license. Source code is available on GitHub and documentation available at https://toytree.readthedocs.io.},
