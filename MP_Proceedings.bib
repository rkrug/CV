  abstract = {West Coast Renosterveld, a Mediterranean-type shrubland vegetation within the Cape Floral Region in South Africa, is typically associated with fertile shale soils in low-lying areas. This association with fertile soils has resulted in extensive transformation of the vegetation through human intervention, leaving less than 5\% of the extent of the original vegetation. The remaining fragments are isolated, within a matrix of agricultural and urban areas, and the vegetation is degraded.},
