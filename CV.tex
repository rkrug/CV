\section{Areas of Interest and expertise}

\subsection{Keywords}

open source tools; data and metadata management; ecological modelling; statistical computing; combined modelling and experimental approaches; invasive species management; spatial pattern analysis; decision support

\subsection{Research}


My current focus of research is in the field of data management, metadata management, workflows and data archival. Recent work included development of a framework for continuous data analysis and archival (ongoing but momentarily on hold); development of data management guidelines for our working group (ongoing), development of a domain specific metadata scheme to make entering and useful metadata as easy as possible for the researcher while at the same providing all the information needed for a useful re-use of the archived data; management of the large scale literature review of the IPBES Global Assessment Chapter 4, including data collection, quality control, analysis, graphing and archival (finalizing).

My previous research interest and focus is on 1) spatial modeling and analysis of pattern and processes and their integration with field experiments and observations, ranging from population (local) to ecosystem (regional) scale, 2) the impact of change (climate change, human impacts, alien spread, \ldots{}) and conscious human actions (management) on these pattern and ultimately on the function of these ecosystems and ecosystem services, and 3) the use of models in decision support of the management of natural resources.

During my research career I have developed and used different types of models, ranging from individual based models, over hybrid models using individual based approaches together with grid based elements, to pure grid based models. The systems studied ranged from populations and communities on the local scale to community dynamics (e.g. grassland - shrubland dynamics, two biocontrol species one invasive species system, spread of three alien invasive species) on the local scale and spread simulations of individual species on the national scale under different climate change scenarios. Most of my research included different management scenarios in the form of alien plant management actions.

Nearly all the simulation and analysis tools I use (and used) are Open Source software (R, GRASS GIS, QGIS). This provides the flexibility to develop the simulation models and analysis protocols without additional costs, distribute them freely and to enable others (scientists as well as implementing agencies like nature conservation agencies) to use and evaluate the code without limitations and without having to purchased specific software, i.e. reproducible research. Reproducible research includes for me to use scripts in analysis and generation of graphs and to make these as well as the simulation models available (as far as funder conditions allow this).

\subsection{IT}

During my research activities I obtained a broad expertise in programing in different languages, linking these through e.g. scripting to into automated process and data work flows, setting up and usage of virtual computing platforms (most recently S3IT Science Cloud) including docker, and virtual machines, setting up and maintenance of small to medium sized MySQL and sqlite databases as well as SAMBA servers and trouble shooting of a wide variety of software as well as hardware problems. In addition, I maintain number of R packages for internal as well as public usage.  

Since I started in Zürich, a substantial part of my work involved research support, ranging from informal discussion on how workflows and scripts could be improved in regards to speed and data management / reproducibility aspects, designing and writing R packages to simplify or automate workflows up to designing workflows which use different computing platforms to the actual management of research data to finally submittiing it to Zenodo for long term preservation.

\subsection{Data Management}


In my role as an elected expert member of the Knowledge and Daa Task Force of IPBES, I was leading the development of the first IPBES data management policy as well as, at the moment, leading the revision of the policy to include aspects not included in traditional data management policies such as aspects specifically related to indigenous and local knowledge. 
In addition, I am involved in the development of educational material to facilitate the implementation of the policy, drafting of a data management vision for IPBES, and other activities concerning data management.


\section{Research Projects}

\begin{itemize}
\item Development of a data management strategy for our research group and of tools to facilitate the provision and
improve the quality of metadata. Also developing of data workflows to make the workflow from data generation to archival as smooth and reproducible as possible.
\item Predictions in Chaotic systems
\item Management of the Literature Analysis (\textbf{IPPBES Global Assessment Chapter 4}) and the generated data for archiving.
\item Analyze measured vertical wind profiles to improve the performance of a forest growth model (CASTANEA) in regards to energy balance
\item modelling temporal and spatial dynamics of a range of different different alien species, alien control agents and 
management strategies
\item Optimising alien invasive plant management through modelling of temportal and spatial modelling
\item Modelling the role of seed dispersal in restoration and biological invasion
\end{itemize}
