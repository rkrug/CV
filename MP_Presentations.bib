  abstract = {With an increasing call for FAIR data, metadata, and it's quality, plays an ever increasing role. Nevertheless, providing metadata is not easily accomplished. One of the reasons for this is the cumbersome way of entering metadata in formats or webforms needed by repositories. Also, there is little or no quality control. Finally, the metadata schemes used by the repositories are either restricted to bibliometric metadata (e.g. DataCite) or are using metadata schemes which have to cover a vast diversity of different data (e.g. EML or Darwin Core). I will present an approach which uses domain specific metadata schemes to overcome these problems, by developing these schemes together with scientists of their domain. It can be employed without detailed technical knowledge, e.g. using spreadsheets and a web browser. This will help researchers recognise the value of metadata for their own research and sharing. The provided validation tool increases quality of metadata.},

  abstract = {The data generated in and for research increases dramatically not only in size but also in the number of data sets. For (later) re-use of data (by the creator of the data as well as by others), the metadata associated with data sets is as important as the data itself. But when `normal' researchers are asked to provide metadata, the enthusiasm is severely dampened due to the complexities of most metadata schemes. It is generally easy to provide general (``bibliographic'') metadata, but this type of metadata is often not very useful when trying to find the data one is looking for. Going further, the definitions of metadata schemes are often so complex, that only somebody very familiar with these (and preferably fluent in reading and writing of xml) is able to use them to their full potential. Consequently, metadata remains the poor stepchild of data sets. I will present an approach which tries to overcome this weakness by defining a domain specific metadata scheme which is being driven by scientists in a specific domain and their needs to find other data sets which can be used in their research use an R package to define the metadata scheme use a spreadsheet to enter the metadata per experiment and not per dataset validate the metadata and creating a user friendly report export the metadata to xml format for further usage bundling functionality as well as scheme definition into one convenient R package. It is planned to bundle this into a shiny application, so that users do need no knowledge of R to use these metadata schemes.},

  abstract = {In January 2020 the first Data Management Policy of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) was approved (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3551079). This milestone was presented at the last WBF in 2020 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3669004). But very soon after its approval, it was realised, that the policy does not tell the whole story: The policy lays a solid foundation for FAIR data management, but it does not address specific requirements of the handling and usage of Indigenous and Local Knowledge (ILK), which is used extensively in IPBES and follows strict rules (see the Talk by Peter Bates in this session). The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance do provide a framework which supplements the FAIR data management principles (see the talk by Stephanie Russo Carroll in this session for a discussion of FAIR and CARE). The IPBES Task Force on Knowledge and Data therefore decided to develop a Data Management Policy v2.0 which incudes CARE as well as FAIR and which pays attention to the special role of Indigenous People and Local Communities (IPLCs). In this talk, I will discuss the motivation behind this decision, the considerations during the process, and the problems and challenges faced. Please also see the e-poster by A. Niamir (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3551078) about the data and knowledge management policy (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3551078 after approval).},
